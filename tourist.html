    images: ["image/chanderifort.jpg", "image/chanderifort.jpeg"],
    description: `Chanderi Fort, located in Chanderi, Madhya Pradesh, is a historic Rajput fort known for its strategic location, imposing structure, and rich history. Built in the 11th century by King Kirti Pal, it stands on a hill overlooking the town and has served as a vital military outpost for centuries.

Key Features and History:

Strategic Location:
Situated on a hilltop, the fort offers panoramic views of the surrounding area, making it a valuable vantage point.

Architectural Styles:
It showcases a blend of Hindu and Mughal architectural styles, reflecting the various dynasties that controlled it.

Gates and Walls:
The fort features three main gates: Khooni Darwaza (main gate), Hawa Paur, and Katti-Ghatti (a gateway carved through a hill).

Jauhar Smarak:
A memorial within the fort complex commemorates the self-sacrifice of Rajput women who performed Jauhar (mass self-immolation) after the battle against Babur.

Historical Significance:
Chanderi Fort has been a witness to numerous battles and power shifts between various dynasties, including the Rajputs, Mughals, and Marathas.

      "raja-rani-mahal": {
  title: "Raja Rani Mahal",
  images: ["image/rajarani.jpg","image/rajaranimahal1.webp"],
  description: `Renowned earlier for its palaces and havelis, Chanderi is once said to have had as many as 260 mahals. 
Today, however, only about 43 of these remain. Situated in the Andar Shehar, the Raja Rani Mahal or the Raj Mahal is actually composed of two separate palaces. The imposing Raja Mahal is a seven-storied structure which has now been attached to the smaller Rani Mahal. 
The two are though built in completely different styles and clearly do not belong to the same time period. The two inscriptions found in a Bawdi within the complex are illegible but the style of calligraphy points to the Khilji period.

This implies that the Raja Mahal must have been originally built by the Khilji rulers in the 15th century. 
The Rani Mahal, however, appears to be an earlier construction. The upper portions of both the Raja and Rani Mahal, which are in the Bundela style, indicate that these structures were repaired and built upon in the 17th century when the Bundelas came to control the region. 
Reeling in a state of disrepair previously, efforts are now on to restore and preserve the palaces.

Khilji Serai:
This serai or rest house was built during the reign of Gyasuddin Khilji by Qazi ibn Mehran. Although in ruins today, the towering minarets betray the structure’s majestic past. 
The building consists of an arched colonnade surrounding a central courtyard with the remains of three distinct gates and possibly a fourth one.`

"jageshwari-mata": {
  title: "Jageshwari Mata Temple",
  images: ["image/jageshwari-mata.jpg","image/jageswari.webp"],
  description: `At a distance of 2 km from Chanderi Bus Station, Jageshwari Mata Temple is a Hindu shrine located in Chanderi, Madhya Pradesh. Situated on a hillside, it is one of the important religious sites in Chanderi.

Jageshwari Temple is an open cave and is dedicated to Goddess Durga who is a Swamyabhu (self-manifested). The initial temple was built during the Mahabharata period by Shishupal. It is believed that certain elements of the current temple were constructed between the 6th and 11th centuries. The murti of Mother Goddess Jageshwari worshipped in the temple is believed to have been the form in which she gave darshan to Shishupal, an ardent devotee of Goddess Durga.

The murti worshipped in the temple only has its head. According to legend, King Kurmadeva was troubled by leprosy. During a hunting expedition, he reached this mountain range and saw a waterfall. When he extended his hands to drink water, his hands were cured. He then bathed in the water, and his leprosy was completely healed. Near the waterfall, the king saw a divine girl. When he tried to talk to her, she disappeared. Later, she appeared in a dream and instructed him to build a grand temple for her but not to open the doors for nine days. The king opened the temple on the third day, due to which only the face of the goddess was revealed.

The modern temple has been built around the cave to accommodate devotees. Subsidiary shrines are dedicated to various forms of Shiva and Shakti. The temple complex houses a unique Shivling carved with 1100 small lingams and another Shivling with Lord Shiva’s faces on all four sides. Two ponds nearby always have cold water flowing from mountain springs.

Every year a fair is organized in Chanderi in the name of Jageshwari Mata. During Chaitri and Sharadiya Navratri, thousands of devotees gather from morning to late night. It is believed that Mata Jageshwari Devi appeared here during Navratri. There are two ways to reach the temple — one via the fort route and another through stairs near the fort.`

  description: `Budhi Chanderi, also known as Chandrapuri, is a historical site on the right bank of the Urr River near Chanderi, Madhya Pradesh. Believed to be the ancient settlement of the Gurjara‑Pratiharas and possibly their capital, the area predates present‑day Chanderi and is mentioned in the Puranas as Chaidnagar.

•Gurjara Pratihara Capital – a major seat of power.  
•Discovery – documented in 1865 by Alexander Cunningham, first Director of the ASI.  

Jain Heritage  
•Around 55 Jain temples once stood here; many are now ruined but several show Bundela‑period restorations.  
•A 16th‑century inscription mentions Nasirabad, named after Nasiruddin Khilji.  
•Well‑preserved pieces have been moved to the Chanderi Museum.

Geography & Features  
• Nidanpur village and the Urr River form its immediate setting.  
• Sagar Kund – a tank at the hill’s foot that supplied the temple complex.  
• ASI‑protected mounds and scattered temple bases testify to the town’s former spread.

Today BudhiChanderi is a protected archaeological zone whose weather‑worn stone blocks and lone spires hint at a prosperous Jain centre and a Gurjara‑Pratihara stronghold, waiting to be fully explored by history buffs.`

        images: ["image/badal mahal.jpg","image/badal mahal1.jpg"],
          description: `Badal Mahal Gate is a significant historical landmark in Chanderi, Madhya Pradesh, known for its unique architecture and historical importance.

        title: "Koshak Mahal",
        images: ["image/kosakmahal1.jpg","image/Koshak_Mahal.jpg"],
        description: "This victory monument constructed by Sultan of Malwa is a mystery box of sorts. Initially planned as a seven storey building, the grungy structure has just three complete storeys. Mehmud Shah Khilji constructed this building to memorialise his victory over Sultan Mehmood Sharki in the battle of Kalpi. It is also said that the Sultan constructed this monument in order to provide employment to the people around the area. The reason for forced employment was due to the shortage of pay and because peasants were not working with the ruse of battle won over at Kalpi. The stone used in the construction not only added beauty to the monument but also ended up creating two water bodies. The stone was quarried from Fatehabad and Chhiyoli River, which resulted in Mallukha and Sultania ponds. The structure bears unique ceiling designs in each of the chambers and the window carvings are also different for each of the four quarters within this square structure. Though it is very unclear if the seven floors were constructed or they crumbled over time, but the present day top floor provides a fantastic view of the paddy fields lined up all across the region. A visit to this structure early in the morning would be best to behold the intricate designs and fantastic architecture."
